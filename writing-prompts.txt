you can set a block of code to repeat while certain conditions are true. As soon as the conditions

Logical Operators

&& also - allows you to match multiple criteria -- both need to be true
   if(16 > 15 && hasLicense === true) {

|| or - allows you to match one criteria OR the other critera -- one has to be true, the other doesn't matter
   if(hasLicense === true || hasLearners === true) {

! not - the criteria does not match = results as true
   if(!isDrunk) {

**  Array

a way to store a bunch of different values under the same name... connected together

var colours = ['yellow','red','green','purple','blue'];

console.log(colours.length); // counts the number of elements in the array -- will print "5"
console.log(colours[1]); // will print "red" (yellow is in position 0)

for(var i = 0; i < colours.length; i++) {
  console.log(colours[i]);
}
